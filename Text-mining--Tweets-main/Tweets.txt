Retaliation It makes me feel so good to hit "sleazebags" back -- much better than seeing a psychiatrist (which I never have!) I went to Wharton, made over $8 billion, employ thousands of people & get insulted by morons who can’t get enough of me on twitter...! 

Isn't it crazy, I'm worth billions of dollars, employ thousands of people, and get libeled by moron bloggers who can't afford a suit! WILD.

 Isn't it crazy that people of little or no talent or success can be so critical of those whose accomplishments are great with no retribution When someone attacks me, I always attack back...except 100x more. This has nothing to do with a tirade but rather, a way of life! When somebody challenges you unfairly, fight back - be brutal, be tough - don't take it. It is always important to WIN! I am a very calm person but love tweeting about both scum and positive subjects. 

Whenever I tweet, some call it a tirade..totally dishonest! How come every time I show anger, disgust or impatience, enemies say I had a tantrum or meltdown—stupid or dishonest people? It’s amazing that people can say such bad things about me but if I say bad things about them, it becomes a national incident. 

I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!  "@danrpriest: @realDonaldTrump Just out of curiosity, what makes you care so much about what they think?"

 I study cowards and stupid people "@MrMarin88: Why does @realDonaldTrump always insist on calling ppl names and trying to taunt like a kid in a schoolyard? Only stupid people Pigs get slaughtered … again.

 Ft Lauderdale plaintiffs must pay me close to $400k in legal fees after Trump trial victory. Many journalists are honest and great - but some are knowingly dishonest and basic scum. They should.be weeded out!
